<h1 class="blue">CALLING IN/FROM LITHUANIA</h1>
<p>Emergency number 112</p>
<p>There are three basic service providers of mobile connectivity: Telia, Bitė, and Tele2. You can get the prepaid cards: Extra, Ežys (Telia), Labas (Bitė) or Pildyk (Tele2) at all newsagents or designated trading places. Each of them offers different tariffs and terms, so you will be able to choose one which suits your needs the best.</p>
<p>For calling to Lithuania from a foreign country, first you need to dial an International Direct Dial (IDD) code (which is the exit code and is different for different country), the code of the country (+370) and then the code of the city and phone number:</p>
<p>  - Landline: IDD/+ 370 (Country Code) + Area Code + Recipient's Number</p>
<p>  - Cellular: IDD/+ 370 (Country Code) + Eight Digits Cellular Number</p>
<p>E.g. to call from landline outside Lithuania to landline phone in Vilnius would be IDD3705xxxxxxx, from cellular to cellular: +3706xxxxxxx.</p>
<h1 class="blue">CLIMATE</h1>
<p>Do not forget that you are coming to a country where the weather in all four seasons is very different.
